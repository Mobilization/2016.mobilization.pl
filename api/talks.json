{"talk-modularizing-apps-framework-oriented-programming":{"title":"Modularizing your apps: Framework Oriented Programming","description_html":"Have you ever tried to reuse code from your mobile apps and you haven’t been able to? Did you start using frameworks only when Apple suggested it for Watch Extensions? With more platforms coming out, there's a clear need of bundling logic that can be reused and shared in multiple platforms. Frameworks will help us with that and will benefit our application code bases in many ways. Learn how to do it, with or without dependency manager involved, recommendations and some caveats you must keep in mind. Start building your own Foundation frameworks, reusable, well designed, and with single responsibilities.","speakers_keys":["speaker-pedro-buendia"],"language":"EN"},"talk-reactive-programming-for-ios-with-interstellar-2":{"title":"Reactive Programming for iOS with Interstellar 2","description_html":"Have a look at how to make Swift and Objective-C interoperability seamless.

This talk will explore the VIPER design with top-down approach, deriving the design decisions from quality attributes of a software system including modularity, reusability, testability, single responsibility and more. You will learn the reasons why the design was initially conceived (Clean Architecture by Uncle Bob) then formalised for mobile (by Mutual Mobile) and how to revise it to fit your purposes. Eventually a modified version of the design, friendly called (B)VIPER, will be discussed as improvement for better reuse of modules among different teams.","speakers_keys":["speaker-nicola-zaghini"],"language":"EN"},"talk-green-dao-3-and-beyond":{"title":"greenDAO 3 and beyond","description_html":"greenDAO is the fastest ORM for Android. greenDAO 3 brings annotations and prepares the way for further enhancements like RX support.

Java 8 has a new steams API, but it's limited to Android N. Backports exist, but it's RxJava that's all the rage, with its elegant threading solution. How do we use lambdas, streams and Rx effectively on Android? Orientation changes and background tasks?
